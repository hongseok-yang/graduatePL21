# CS520 Theory of Programming Languages, Spring 2021, KAIST 

This is a webpage of the course "CS520 Theory of Programming Languages", which is offered at the KAIST CS department in the spring of 2021. The webpage will contain links to course-related materials and announcements.

CS520 is an advanced graduate-level course on the theories of programming languages. Its goal is to expose students to rigorous mathematical foundations for programming languages and systems, and mathematical techniques for formally reasoning about  programs written in those languages. The course will largely follow Reynolds's textbook "Theories of Programming Languages", which provides good mathematical treatment of a wide range of programming constructs through axiomatic, denotational and operational semantics. 

The prerequisite of the course is CS320, the undergraduate-level programming-language course offered at KAIST, or a similar course. The course will be heavy in math, and we expect students to be comfortable with doing and reading rigorous mathematical proofs.

## 4. In-class Oral Tests

We will run four in-class oral tests using ZOOM. During these tests, students will be randomly chosen and asked questions about topics covered by the course. We allocate 7.5% of the total marks of the course to each test. If a student does not attend one of the tests, she or he will get 0 for that test. The four tests will be scheduled on the following dates:

* 03/29(Mon) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 1:00pm - 2:15pm.
* 04/19(Mon) (Midterm Exam Week) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 1:00pm - 2:30pm.
* 05/17(Mon) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 1:00pm - 2:15pm.
* 06/14(Mon) (Final Exam Week) - In-class oral test at ZOOM from 1:00pm - 2:30pm.

We adopt the following policy for these tests.

1. We do attendance check at 1:30pm, but if a student is asked a question before this attendence check but is absent, she or he will be regarded as having missed the test and get 0.
2. In these tests, students will have to answer questions using their microphones. Also, they will have to 
turn on their cameras, at least when we do attendance check. Thus, students are strongly advised to ensure that 
their microphones and cameras work properly before these oral tests. If a student cannot use a microphone and a camera 
because of a special circumstance, she or he has to explain the circumstance to the teaching staffs before the test
and arrange a way to participate in the test.
3. During these tests, students do not have to answer in English, although questions will be asked in English.

## 6. Lecture Notes

The recorded online lectures are based on the following hand-written notes, which summarise the contents of the textbooks. Reading the notes and solving exercisers in the notes is a recommended way to study the topics of the course.

* Predicate Logic (Ch1) ([note1](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note1.jpg), [note2](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note2.jpg), [note3](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note3.jpg), [note4](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note4.jpg), [note5](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note5.jpg), [note6](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note6.jpg), [note7](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note7.jpg), [note8](https://github.com/hongseok-yang/graduatePL20/blob/master/Lectures/Lecture2/note8.jpg)).

## 7. Two Critical Surveys

One important part of this course is to study assigned topics for oneself, and write surveys about them, which also contain critiques or original thoughts of the student. This assignment accounts for the 30% of the total marks of this course. In order to get full marks, a student has to show in his or her write-up that she or he has understood the topics well, carried out in-depth studies on the topics, and thought hard and originally about them. Our evaluation adopts the following criterion: the clarity of writing (20%), the level of understanding a topic and existing work about it (40%), and the demonstration of original thoughts and insights (40%). Here are the details of this assignment.

1. Don't postpone this assignments until the last moment.
2. There are two assignments. In both cases, a submission should be at most 3 pages not including bibliography.
3. First assignment:
   1. Topic: Concurrent separation logic.
   2. Deadline: __**23:59 of the 28th of April in 2021 (Wednesday). Summit in KLMS.**__
   3. Some references that may help you to start: 
      1. Peter O'Hearn. [Resources, Concurrency, and Local Reasoning.](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/papers/concurrency.pdf) This is the paper that started concurrent separation logic.
      2. Stephen Brookes and Peter O'Hearn. [Concurrent Separation Logic.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2984450.2984457)
      3. Peter O'Hearn. [Separation Logic.](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/2/234356-separation-logic/pdf)
      4. Peter O'Hearn, John Reynolds, and Hongseok Yang. [Local Reasoning about Programs that Alter Data Structures.](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/papers/localreasoning.pdf) This paper describes one of the key ideas behind separation logic, called local reasoning.
      5. Stephen Brookes. [A Semantics for Concurrent Separation Logic.](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~brookes/papers/seplogicrevisedfinal.pdf)
   4. Questions to think about:
      1. What is separation logic? What is concurrent separation logic?
      2. Which aspects of concurrent separation logic help construct the proofs of concurrent programs more easily?
      3. What recent research results result from concurrent separation logic?
      4. Can you find a new application where concurrent separation logic or its key ideas can be applied?
      5. How would you improve concurrent separation logic?
      6. If you want to show the termination (more generally liveness properties), how should you extend concurrent separation logic?
4. Second assignment.
   1. Topic: Select a paper in POPL'19, POPL'20, POPL'21, PLDI'19, and PLDI'20, and write a critical survey on a research topic or problem of the paper. Write a general survey on the topic, not just a particular result of the paper. Looking at the related work section of the paper will help you to find related work. PLDI and POPL are two major international conferences in programming languages.
   2. Deadline: __**23:59 of the 7th of June in 2021 (Monday). Submit in KLMS.**__


## 8. Study Materials

We will mainly follow Reynolds's book, but study the materials appearing in Chapters 8 and 10 of Tennent's book.

* Main Textbook 1 : [Theories of Programming Languages, John C Reynolds](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/theories-of-programming-languages/19530A88F3471B2A7D9891770B21DAF9), Cambridge University Press, 1998. 
* Main Textbook 2 : Semantics of Programming Languages, Robert D. Tennent, Prentice Hall, 1991. Chapters 8 and 10 only.

In addition to the two books above, the following books will have further information about the topics covered in the course. In particular, Gunter's book goes deep into the domain theory, and Pierce's book into the type theory.

* Auxiliary Textbook 1 : Semantics of Programming Languages: Structures and Techniques, Carl A. Gunter, MIT Press, 1992.
* Auxiliary Textbook 2 : Types and Programming Languages, Benjamin C. Pierce, MIT Press, 2002.
* Auxiliary Textbook 3 : Formal Semantics of Programming Languages: an Introduction, Glynn Winskel, MIT Press, 1993.

The following classic papers or their recent reprints contain deep insight into some of topics that we study throughout the course.

* John C. Reynolds, [Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages](https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1010027404223), Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation, 1998.
